#Participatory Mapping using Google Forms & Leaflet

This is a simple web app that uses Google Forms and Leaflet to allow for participatory mapping in any modern web browser.

##Description

This is a heavily modified version of [aogdp's gps mapper](https://aogdp.github.io/gpsform/), but modified to allow for participatory mapping.

Basically, in its current form, it gives three markers that respondents can choose from to add to a webmap.
